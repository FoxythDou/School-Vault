### Histogram
-   Graphical display of data, Using different hieghts of bars
-   $y$ = Frequency
-   $x$ = Class Boundary

**Steps:**
1. Make the graph, and then add the corresponding intervals.

2. Plot the data (Bars side to side)

### Frequency Polygon
- Closed Figure
- Shows the amount off frequency to the class mark
-   $y$ **= Frequency**
-   $x$ **= Class mark**

**Steps:**
1. Make the graph, and then add the corresponding intervals.

2. Plot the dots, and connect the corresponding dots with lines.

### Ogive
- Like the [[001 Organization Of Data Graphs#Frequency Polygon | Frequency Polygon]], But this is Culmative frequency. Another way is this isn't a closed shape.
- $y$ **= Culmative Frequency**
	- Usually use ==Less Than Culmative frequency==, Unless told not to do so.
- $x$ **= Upper Boundary**

**Steps:**

1. Make the graph, and then add the corresponding intervals.

2. Plot All Points, Then connect the lines.
