### Mean
- Average of the set data
```ad-form
$$\overline x = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$

- **Where:**
	- $n$  **= is the amount of total numbers **
	- $\sum x$  **= Sum of all numbers**
```

- **Example:**
	- <span class='centerImg'>![[Pasted image 20211011101220.png]]</span>
	- Answer in this example is 7.8

### Median
- Middle of the set data 
-  Make sure you ==arrange this.== From 4,1,2,7 to 1,2,4,7
- **Formula (For odd set of numbers):**

```ad-form
$$\overline x = (\frac{n+1}{2}) th$$

**Where:**
- $n$ is for amount of data

```

- **Example**
	-  <span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011101721.png|500]]  </span>
	-  In here, We got 3rd and we're going to find the third in the set data. So that means that our Median is 8.

```ad-form
- **Formula (For even set of numbers)**
$$\overline x = \frac{1}{2}\bigg [(\frac{n}{2})th + (\frac{n}{2} + 1)th \bigg ]$$
```
- **Example**
	- <span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011102016.png | 500]] </span>
	- As you can see here, We arranged it from lowest to highest then did this formula since n *(10 numbers)* is an even number.

```ad-note
When you are going to use mean, Remember that if **==no outlier = mean==**
```

### Mode
- Frequent Data
- Make sure you ==arrange this==. From 4,1,2,7 to 1,2,4,7
- After that, Just find the repeating numbers of the set.
	- <span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011102144.png|500]]  </span>
- There can be 2 modes. Same goes with none.
