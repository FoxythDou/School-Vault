### Mean
```ad-form
$$\overline x = \frac{\sum(fx)}{\sum f}$$ ^a668d6
- Formula
	- $\overline x$ = Mean of grouped data
	- $f$ = Frequency of each Class
	- $x$ = Class mark of each class
	- $\sum$ = Sum
```
- **Example:**
<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211027181700.png]] </span>

1. Find each midpoint of every class. 


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211028073306.png]]  </span>

 2. After calculating the midpoint, You do $f \times x$ which would give us the $fx$ coulumn in this table.

After which do the [[003 Grouped Central Measures of Tendencies#^a668d6 | formula]],  and that's your mean.

### Median
```ad-form 
$$\overline x = lb_{me} + \Bigg[\frac {\frac {\sum f}{2} - cf}{f_{me}}\Bigg]i$$


- **Where:**
	- $\overline x$ = Median of grouped data
	- $lb_{me}$ = Lower boundary of median class
	- $\sum f$ = Sum Frequencies
	- $cf$ = Culmative Frequency of the lower class next to the median class
	- $f_{me}$ = Frequency of the median class
	- $i$ = Class interval
```
- **Example:**

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211028084803.png |500]]</span>

1.  Find the median class by  $\frac {\sum f}{2}$ and check the Nearest result in the Culmative frequency.


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211028085025.png | 500]]  </span>

2. In this case the $\frac {\sum f}{2} = 20$ , And the nearest culmative frequency is 23. So that is your median class.

	- **Solution **
		- $\overline x = 25.5 + \bigg[\frac{\frac {40}{2} - 9}{14}\bigg]5$
		- $\overline x = 29.4$

---

### Mode
```ad-form
$$x = lb_{mo} + \bigg [\frac {D_{1}}{D_{1}+D_{2}} \bigg ] i $$

- **Where**
	- $x$ = Mode of grouped data
	- $lb_{mo}$ = Lower boundary of modal class
	- $D_{1}$ =  Modal class - Lower class
	- $D_{2}$ =  Modal class - Upper class
	- $i$ = Class width
```

1. First find what class has the most frequency. That would be your modal class. ^[[[002 Measure of Central Tendencies#Mode| What is mode?]]] The one below  that class is  D<sub>1</sub>. The one above that class is D<sub>2</sub>
<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211028091654.png]] </span>

```ad-note
**D<sub>1</sub>** = Modal class - Lower class
**D<sub>2</sub>** =  Modal class - Lower class

***Both D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> is always positive***
```

2. Now, since we have all the things we need we need to solve it. 

	- **Solution**
		- $\overline x = 30.5 + \bigg [ \frac{1}{1+1} \bigg ] 5$
		- $\overline x = 33$
