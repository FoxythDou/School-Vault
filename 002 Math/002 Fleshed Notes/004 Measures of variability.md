### What is Measures of Variability?
- This is the measure of the dispersion of scores.
	- How far this data is from this data
- Multiple ways to get it, so be wise! 

### Range
```ad-form
$$r = H - L$$
Where: 
- $r$ = Range
- $H$ = Highest value
- $L$ = Lowest value
```

- Solving

1. First, we get the [[002 Measure of Central Tendencies#Mean|mean ]] of the 2 families  
2. Calculate the range. By finding the range here, we see that both of the family's range is different. In this case we can pick the highest range, which is Family A.
	- $range$ $A = 19$
	- $range$ $B = 10$

If you look here, the range of student B and C is on a tie. ==If this is the case, *range is not a reliable measure*.==

### Mean Deviation 
- This is the average distance from the data's mean.
```ad-form
***Ungrouped:***
$$MD = \frac {\sum \bigg[x - \overline x \bigg ]}{n}$$

Where: 
- $MD$ = Mean Derivation 
- $x$ = Individual value (Scores)
- $\overline x$ = Mean
- $n$ = Number of values

<br></br>
***Grouped:***
$$MD = \frac {\sum \big( f |x - \overline x |\big)}{\sum f}$$

Where: 
- $MD$ = Mean Derivation
- $x$ = Individual value (Scores)
- $\overline x$ = Mean
- $\sum f$ = Sum of the frequency

```
- ***Ungrouped***
	- We would use this table. Here's the solved version.

- ***Grouped***
	- For this, we just make a table of the values we need, shown under the table.
		- $|x-\overline x|$
		-  $f$ $|x-\overline x|$

### Standard Deviation
- This is the *How many values* are near  the mean of the set
- Remember that smaller SD, The better performance of the class. 
- *Variance =  $\sqrt SD$*
```ad-form
***Ungrouped***

$$SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x- \overline{x})^2}{n}}$$

***Grouped***

$$SD = \sqrt{\frac{ n (\sum fx^2) - (\sum fx)^2} {n(n-1) }}$$

Where: 
- $x$ = Individual Value
- $\overline x$ = mean
- $n$ - Number of values
```
