Title: Mean (Ungrouped)
Front: Formula is?
 <center> \(\overline x =\) {{c1::\(\frac{\sum x}{n}\)}}</center>

Title: Measures of central tendencies
Front: Doe will use {Median} as his measure for finding the average of his data, *but he has outliers*.
Back:  He will use median since mean can be affected by outliers. **Median isn't affected a bit by outliers.**
