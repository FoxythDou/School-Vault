# Hello!

This is a quick heads up on obsidian. I have downloaded few plugins so that you have a less more hassle and did some implementations.

##### Implementation of folder system

![[Pasted image 20211006194105.png]]

I have made hubs, where in you input the coverage (Topics, and its note types).

The note types are:
1. Drafted *(The brush icon on the image)*
	- From disscussion, basically screenshots & notes of the discussion
2. Fleshed *(The paper icon on the image)*
	- Tidy, and cleaned up for your brain to understand.

Once your done with a topic, Link it up to the coverages tab.

Like this. To link, just type 2 brackets (`[[]]`) and type the name of the note.

Here are more stuff to take account.

Name of note: Name of the note,
Heading (#): Links to the specific heading of the note
Display name (|): Changes the display name.

Here's an example 

`[[000 Home#üè∑ Tags | Homepage's tags]]`
[[000 Home#üè∑ Tags | Homepage's tags]]

## Why do we name the files 000 Name?
- To order them.
