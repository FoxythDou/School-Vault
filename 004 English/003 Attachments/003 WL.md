Rise of AI affecting jobs to exist.

- AI is both good and bad
- It helps automate jobs and make things efficient
- But with this we loose jobs, Which is kind of bad
- But sooner or later we find new jobs
- and we will have this cycle repeat again and again 
- We will be a civiziation that is depenedent on the use of AI and technology
- Which is both good and scary
