# Act 1.2 (Q2): Heresies Against Jesus

###### Adoptionism
- "God adopted Jesus as his son, as he lead a sinless life"
- It is wrong since though Jesus is human and divine, he was born by the holy spirit by God's will and compassion. God didn't pick someone for Jesus' role but rather create one to ensure the legacy of the kingdom of heaven will be alive.

###### Apollinarianism
- "Jesus' two natures - human and divine - could not co-exist in one person."
- Jesus's nature doesnt co-exist, rather unite to make one whole new Personality. Jesus himself, He has existed and he will always be. 
###### Arianism
- Jesus was made at the first day of the creation story, So that means Jesus himself is finite and human, Therefore not divine.
- Jesus is both human and divine. He was always divine, He was human when he became incarnate and chose to be sacrificed for the sins we have made. This doesn't mean that Jesus has lost his divinity however.
###### Docetism
- "Jesus' body was an illusion, and was only seemed that way."
- If this were true that means Jesus' suffering and pain on the cross was also an illusion. If that was an illusion, how are we still living today? Without Jesus' physical body he wouldn't have done the salvation of the world.
###### Monophysitism
- Jesus only had one nature. Being divine.
- If Jesus himself was divine, He would have not saved us from our own individual sins and sufferings, Just like Docetism.
###### Nestorianism
- the 2 natures are independent and loosely united.
- If jesus' 2 natures are independent, It would have been not possible for him to follow god's path and mission that was laid before him. Divine was the guiding force for him to be god, and Human for understanding emotions and suffering in the world.
