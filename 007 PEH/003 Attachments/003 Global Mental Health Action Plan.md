# Global Mental Health Action Plan
**Role:** Researcher

My research shows that mental healthcare remains an under-funded and neglected aspect of healthcare here in the Phillipines. Until now, we lack a formal structure in which to enshrine the rights of those people with mental illness, their families, and the rights and responsibilities of mental health professionals and government in relation to mental health.

Though it may seem underresourced and not big enough to handle the country,The Philippine Mental Health Act of 2017 (RA 11036) is still a major step onto acknowledging mental issues than ever before.
