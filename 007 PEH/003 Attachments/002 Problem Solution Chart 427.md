### **Who?**
- My local community

### Problem
- **What?** - Increased cases on COVID-19
- **Why?** - Most of them go outside without wearing that much protection

### Solutions/Result
| - Solution -                                                  |             - Result -              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------:|
| **1.** Give them masks and face shields                       |     Less transmission of COVID      |
| **2.** Impose a fee for those who dont abide on wearing masks | People are more eager to follow it. |

### End Results
- The rate of transmission and cases of my barangay would lessen and more people would be more encouraged to follow because of the fee
