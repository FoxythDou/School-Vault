For the first 4 meetings, we try to increase our understanding on the following:

# Discussion
### Summary of Kinematic Equations

 ### Displacement-time graph
 ![[Pasted image 20211011081455.png]]
 aka distance/position-time graph

 x - dependent
 y - independent

Finding for **SPEED** or **VELOCITY**
![[Pasted image 20211011082654.png]]
- This graph is telling that it has constant speed (+1.67 m/s)
- Increasing displacement and time
- zero acceleration since its constant

- Time is increasing, but displacement is decreasing 
- Its decreasing at a rate of -1.67 m/s back to the origin at a constant speed

![[Pasted image 20211011084116.png]]
- Horizontal
- as the time increases, the displacement is a constant zero.
-  Zero acceleration

- Its not possible cause time can't stop (Unless your a stand user)

- Increasing displacement but the interval is decreasing is it like instead of 10 m/s constant it goes from 10 m/s then 8m/s then 5 m/s
- In short its increasing but the amount that is being added on is decreasing
